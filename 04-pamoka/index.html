    <p> <i>On paper, taking birds from the wild and selling them is illegal in many Asian countries, including <br>
        Indonesia, but the laws are rarely enforced, says <a href="https://mcrsociety.org/about-us/our-team/"  target="_blank">Chris Shepherd</a> , executive director of Monitor, a <br>
        British Columbia-based nonprofit focused on ending illegal and unsustainable <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/poaching-animals?loggedin=true&rnd=1684269614066"  target="_blank">wildlife trade </a> in lesser- ,<br>
        known species. That's in part because not enough people care about the fate of songbirds, which are <br>
         also understudied, he says.</i></p>

        <p> One common method poachers use is to go into the forest and play recordings of birds singing, then trap the curious songbirds that respond in glue stuck to trees or with finely woven mist nets.</p>
        <p>Another Cissa species, the Javan green magpie, is critically endangered due to illegal trade. "The future of this species depends entirely on successful conservation efforts," Shepherd says. </p>
        <p>“It's more important now than ever to stop the poachers, end the trade, close down the markets, and do everything we can to reverse the decline” of songbirds, he says.</p>

    <h2>'True change is generational'</h2>
    <article class="size-781px">
        <p> As he continues his quest, Sartore remains optimistic. He's particularly encouraged by the young people he's met who are familiar with Photo Ark and the need to safeguard species.</p>
        <p> “I have adopted the philosophy that all we can do is try and hopefully the public will respond to that more and more,” Sartore says.</p>
        <p>“It seems like people are becoming more aware of climate change and habitat loss, but true change is generational—I'm hoping for the best.”</p>
